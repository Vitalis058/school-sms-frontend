interface StudentResult {
  id: string;
  studentId: string;
  student: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    admissionNumber: string;
  };
  subject: {
    name: string;
    subjectCode: string;
  };
  score: number;
  maxScore: number;
  percentage: number;
  grade: string;
  term: string;
  academicYear: string;
  assessmentType: string;
}
```

### StudentReportData Interface
```typescript
interface StudentReportData {
  student: {
    id: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    admissionNumber: string;
    grade: string;
    stream: string;
  };
  subjects: {
    name: string;
    code: string;
    score: number;
    maxScore: number;
    percentage: number;
    grade: string;
    position: number;
    remarks: string;
  }[];
  summary: {
    totalMarks: number;
    totalMaxMarks: number;
    overallPercentage: number;
    overallGrade: string;
    position: number;
    totalStudents: number;
  };
  term: string;
  academicYear: string;
}
```

## Key Features Implementation

### 1. Advanced Filtering System
```typescript
const filteredResults = mockResults.filter((result) => {
  const matchesSearch = 
    result.student.firstName.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
    result.student.lastName.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
    result.student.admissionNumber.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
    result.subject.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
  
  const matchesSubject = selectedSubject === "all" || result.subject.name === selectedSubject;
  const matchesTerm = selectedTerm === "all" || result.term === selectedTerm;
  const matchesYear = result.academicYear === selectedYear;
  
  return matchesSearch && matchesSubject && matchesTerm && matchesYear;
});
```

### 2. Report Card Template
- Professional layout with school branding
- Comprehensive student information section
- Detailed academic performance table
- Overall performance summary
- Grading scale reference
- Signature sections for stakeholders

### 3. Performance Analytics

const handlePrint = useReactToPrint({
  content: () => reportRef.current,
  documentTitle: `Report Card - ${previewData?.student.firstName} ${previewData?.student.lastName}`,
});
```

## Usage Examples
